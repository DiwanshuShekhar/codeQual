Step 3: Evaluate the functionality of the code. Following criteria can be used:

a. **Correctness**: Verify if the code accomplishes what it claims to do and avoids logical errors.

b. **Edge cases**: Assess if the code handles edge cases well. This might include empty inputs, maximum or minimum possible values, or unusual combinations of parameters.

c. **Failure modes**: Consider how the code behaves under failure scenarios. This might involve unavailable resources, invalid inputs, or extreme conditions.

Step 4: Provide a recommendation based on the assessment. This should ideally include:

a. A summary of findings related to code quality based on the above steps.

b. Suggested improvements or optimizations if any are identified.

c. A final verdict on whether the code meets a high-quality standard or if improvements are required.
