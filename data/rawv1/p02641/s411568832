Given are an integer X and an integer sequence of length N: p_1, \ldots, p_N.
Among the integers not contained in the sequence p_1, \ldots, p_N (not necessarily positive), find the integer nearest to X, that is, find the integer whose absolute difference with X is the minimum. If there are multiple such integers, report the smallest such integer.
