"""
We have a string X, which has an even number of characters. Half the characters are S, and the other half are T.
Takahashi, who hates the string ST, will perform the following operation 10^{10000} times:

Among the occurrences of ST in X as (contiguous) substrings, remove the leftmost one. If there is no occurrence, do nothing.

Find the eventual length of X.
Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
