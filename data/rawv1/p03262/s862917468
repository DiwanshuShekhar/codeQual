"""
There are N cities on a number line. The i-th city is located at coordinate x_i.
Your objective is to visit all these cities at least once.
In order to do so, you will first set a positive integer D.
Then, you will depart from coordinate X and perform Move 1 and Move 2 below, as many times as you like:

Move 1: travel from coordinate y to coordinate y + D.
Move 2: travel from coordinate y to coordinate y - D.

Find the maximum value of D that enables you to visit all the cities.
Here, to visit a city is to travel to the coordinate where that city is located.
