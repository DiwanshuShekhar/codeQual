The algorithm works as follow:
1. Start by initializing a matrix `s` with zeros of size `H x W`.
2. Assign unique numbers to strawberries in the input, and zero to empty cells while reading the input.
3. For each row:
   a. Skip the row if it has only zeros, i.e., if it doesn't contain any strawberries.
   b. For rows that contain strawberries, replace zeros with the closest strawberry number on their left. If a cell is a strawberry, remember its number to fill subsequent zeros until the next strawberry is found.
4. After processing all rows, if there are any rows consisting solely of zeros (which means they were below or above a row of strawberries), fill those rows with numbers from the nearest non-zero row above or below them.

The most crucial part of the algorithm is to assign numbers correctly according to the strawberries' distribution and ensure that each strawberry leads to a separate piece when cut. In summary, the operation proceeds row-wise to decorate each section with a unique number; then, unfilled rows are updated based on their closest filled neighbors.

Let's write down the pseudo-code based on the algorithm described:

```python
input H, W, K
initialize matrix s with zeros, size H x W
num = 1
for each row i from 0 to H-1
    read input row
    for each column j from 0 to W-1
        if cell contains a strawberry
            s[i, j] = num
            num += 1
        else
            s[i, j] = 0

for each row i from 0 to H-1
    if row contains a strawberry
        for each cell j in row i
            if cell contains a strawberry
                remember strawberry number
            else
                fill cell with last remembered strawberry number
    else
        copy numbers from nearest filled row above or below

for each row in s
    print the row as output
```

Expecting value: line 2 column 1 (char 1)
