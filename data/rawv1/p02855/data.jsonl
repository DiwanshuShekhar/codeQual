K of these sections has a strawberry on top of each of them.\nThe positions of the strawberries are given to you as H \\times W characters s_{i, j} (1 \\leq i \\leq H, 1 \\leq j \\leq W). If s_{i, j} is #, the section at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left contains a strawberry; if s_{i, j} is ., the section does not contain one. There are exactly K occurrences of #s.\nTakahashi wants to cut this cake into K pieces and serve them to the contestants. Each of these pieces must satisfy the following conditions:\n\nHas a rectangular shape.\nContains exactly one strawberry.\n\nOne possible way to cut the cake is shown below:\n\nFind one way to cut the cake and satisfy the condition. We can show that this is always possible, regardless of the number and positions of the strawberries.", "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "5", "pythonic": "4", "error_handling": "3", "efficiency": "3"}}
