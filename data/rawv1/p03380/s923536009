Let {\rm comb}(n,r) be the number of ways to choose r objects from among n objects, disregarding order.
From n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, select two numbers a_i > a_j so that {\rm comb}(a_i,a_j) is maximized.
If there are multiple pairs that maximize the value, any of them is accepted.
