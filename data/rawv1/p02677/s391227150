A, B, H, M = map(int, input().split())

theta = abs((30*H + M*0.5) - 6*M)
theta = min(theta, 360-theta)

The solution first calculates the angle `theta` in degrees between the two hands. To account for the shortest angle, it selects the smaller of `theta` and `360-theta`.

`A` and `B` represent the lengths of the hour and minute hands, respectively. The formula utilizes the law of cosines to calculate the distance between the tips of the two hands.

`cos(radians(theta))` converts the angle in degrees to radians as the `cos` function requires the angle in radians.
