"""
Takahashi made N problems for competitive programming.
The problems are numbered 1 to N, and the difficulty of Problem i is represented as an integer d_i (the higher, the harder).
He is dividing the problems into two categories by choosing an integer K, as follows:

A problem with difficulty K or higher will be for ARCs.
A problem with difficulty lower than K will be for ABCs.

How many choices of the integer K make the number of problems for ARCs and the number of problems for ABCs the same?
Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
