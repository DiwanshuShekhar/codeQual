Explaining this solution, it essentially follows these steps:
1. We first calculate the cumulative sum of the `A` list so that we can quickly find totals for any section of the sequence as needed.
2. We generate a list, `max_nodes`, containing the maximum possible number of nodes at each level of the tree.
3. We enforce the constraint that no negative number of nodes is possible, which assures us that a valid binary tree can be formed.
4. We then iterate from the root to the leaves (depth 0 to N+1, computing the maximum sum of all nodes allowed considering the constraints at each depth level).
5. If there are at least as many nodes required by `A[d]` at each depth `d`, and no more than twice the remaining nodes after subtracting `A[d-1]`, the sum of `A[d]` and potentially half of the remaining nodes from the previous level gives us the maximum number of vertices.
6. If at any point the amount of nodes calculated turns negative, meaning the conditions can't be met, the function returns `-1`.
