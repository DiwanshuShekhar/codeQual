Snuke signed up for a new website which holds programming competitions.
He worried that he might forget his password, and he took notes of it.
Since directly recording his password would cause him trouble if stolen,
he took two notes: one contains the characters at the odd-numbered positions, and the other contains the characters at the even-numbered positions.
You are given two strings O and E. O contains the characters at the odd-numbered positions retaining their relative order, and E contains the characters at the even-numbered positions retaining their relative order.
Restore the original password.
