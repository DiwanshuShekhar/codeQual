"""
In a flower bed, there are N flowers, numbered 1,2,......,N. Initially, the heights of all flowers are 0.
You are given a sequence h=\{h_1,h_2,h_3,......\} as input. You would like to change the height of Flower k to h_k for all k (1 \leq  k \leq N), by repeating the following "watering" operation:

Specify integers l and r. Increase the height of Flower x by 1 for all x such that l \leq x \leq r.

Find the minimum number of watering operations required to satisfy the condition.
Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
