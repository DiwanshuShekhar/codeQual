"""
This code defines a problem scenario involving array operations, given N operations where each operation involves adding b_i copies of an integer a_i to an array. The task is to find the K-th smallest integer in the array after performing all N operations. The code first reads inputs for N and K, followed by N pairs of integers representing each operation. Then, it sorts these operations based on the integer a_i to be inserted. Next, it iterates over the sorted operations, maintaining a cumulative sum of b_i, to find the point where the K-th position is reached or exceeded, at which point it prints the value of a_i corresponding to that operation, effectively identifying the K-th smallest integer after all operations.
