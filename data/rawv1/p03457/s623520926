AtCoDeer the deer is going on a trip in a two-dimensional plane.
In his plan, he will depart from point (0, 0) at time 0, then for each i between 1 and N (inclusive), he will visit point (x_i,y_i) at time t_i.
If AtCoDeer is at point (x, y) at time t, he can be at one of the following points at time t+1: (x+1,y), (x-1,y), (x,y+1) and (x,y-1).
Note that he cannot stay at his place.
Determine whether he can carry out his plan.
