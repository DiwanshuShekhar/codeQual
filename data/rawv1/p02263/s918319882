"""
Reverse Polish notation is a notation where every operator follows all of its operands. For example, an expression (1+2)*(5+4) in the conventional Polish notation can be represented as 1 2 + 5 4 + * in the Reverse Polish notation. One of advantages of the Reverse Polish notation is that it is parenthesis-free.
