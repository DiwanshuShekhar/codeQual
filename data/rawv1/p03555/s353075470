C11 C12 C13
C21 C22 C23
```
The task is to determine if the grid remains the same when rotated 180 degrees. This essentially means checking if `C11` is the same as `C23`, `C12` is the same as `C22`, and `C13` is the same as `C21`.

Let's break down the steps required to solve this problem, considering the input, processing, and output:

1. **Input**:
    - Read the first and second row of the grid, which can be represented as strings `C1` and `C2`.

2. **Processing**:
    - To check if the grid remains the same when rotated 180 degrees, compare `C1[0]` with `C2[2]`, `C1[1]` with `C2[1]`, and `C1[2]` with `C2[0]`.

3. **Output**:
    - If all the above comparisons are true, print "YES".
    - Otherwise, print "NO".

Here's how the solution can be structured in pseudo-code:

```
# Step 1: Input
Read C1 (string)
Read C2 (string)

# Step 2: Processing and Step 3: Output
If (C1[0] == C2[2]) and (C1[1] == C2[1]) and (C1[2] == C2[0]) then
    Print "YES"
Else
    Print "NO"
```

Let's translate this approach to Python code:

```python
# Input
C1 = input()
C2 = input()

# Check if the grid remains the same when rotated 180 degrees
if C1[0] == C2[2] and C1[1] == C2[1] and C1[2] == C2[0]:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
