The core concept to solve this problem is counting the number of distinct characters at each position across the three strings, `A`, `B`, and `C`. With this count, itâ€™s straightforward to know the number of operations needed:

- If all characters at position `i` are the same (`distinct_chars == 1`), no operation is needed.
- If there are two distinct characters at position `i` (`distinct_chars == 2`), one change is needed to make all three characters the same.
- If all three characters are different at position `i` (`distinct_chars == 3`), two changes are needed.
