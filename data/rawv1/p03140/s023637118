You are given three strings A, B and C. Each of these is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.
Our objective is to make all these three strings equal. For that, you can repeatedly perform the following operation:

Operation: Choose one of the strings A, B and C, and specify an integer i between 1 and N (inclusive). Change the i-th character from the beginning of the chosen string to some other lowercase English letter.

What is the minimum number of operations required to achieve the objective?
