This code first imports the needed deque module from the collections library, which is a double-ended queue that allows adding and removing elements from either end. The code then initializes an empty deque to represent a double linked list.

For each instruction (`n` lines), it reads the command (`cmd`) and its arguments (`args`) as input. It performs different operations based on the value of `cmd`:

- If the command is `insert`, it inserts (`appendleft`) the specified element (`args[0]`) at the beginning of the deque.
- If the command is `delete`, it tries to remove the first occurrence of the specified element (`args[0]`). If the element is not in the deque, it catches the `ValueError` and does nothing.
- If the command is `deleteFirst`, it removes the first element from the deque using `popleft`.
- If the command is `deleteLast`, it removes the last element from the deque using `pop`.

Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
