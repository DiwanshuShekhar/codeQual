# Input data
X, Y, Z = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the gap left after one person
# and two gaps are seated
gap_length = Y + 2 * Z

# Determine the maximum number of people that can be seated
# by subtracting the initial gap length from the total seat width
# and then dividing by the gap length, discarding any remainder
people_count = (X - gap_length) // (Y + Z)

# Output the result
print(people_count)
Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
