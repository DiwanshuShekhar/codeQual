"""
Let us define the beauty of a sequence (a_1,... ,a_n) as the number of pairs of two adjacent elements in it whose absolute differences are d.
For example, when d=1, the beauty of the sequence (3, 2, 3, 10, 9) is 3.
There are a total of n^m sequences of length m where each element is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive).
Find the beauty of each of these n^m sequences, and print the average of those values.
