People say that one of them will bear golden apples.\nWe want to deploy some number of inspectors so that each of these trees will be inspected.\nEach inspector will be deployed under one of the trees. For convenience, we will assign numbers from 1 through N to the trees. An inspector deployed under the i-th tree (1 \\leq i \\leq N) will inspect the trees with numbers between i-D and i+D (inclusive).\nFind the minimum number of inspectors that we need to deploy to achieve the objective.", "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "5", "pythonic": "5", "error_handling": "4", "efficiency": "4"}}
