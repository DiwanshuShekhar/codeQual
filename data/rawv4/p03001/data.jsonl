The coordinates of the four vertices are (0,0), (W,0), (W,H), and (0,H).\nYou are given a point (x,y) which is within the rectangle or on its border. We will draw a straight line passing through (x,y) to cut the rectangle into two parts. Find the maximum possible area of the part whose area is not larger than that of the other. Additionally, determine if there are multiple ways to cut the rectangle and achieve that maximum.", "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "5", "pythonic": "5", "error_handling": "4", "efficiency": "5"}}
