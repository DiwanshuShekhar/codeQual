We have N clocks. The hand of the i-th clock (1≤i≤N) rotates through 360° in exactly T_i seconds.
Initially, the hand of every clock stands still, pointing directly upward.
Now, Dolphin starts all the clocks simultaneously.
In how many seconds will the hand of every clock point directly upward again?
