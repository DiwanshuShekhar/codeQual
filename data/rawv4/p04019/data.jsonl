He is going on an N-day trip.\nAt the beginning of Day 1, he is at home. His plan is described in a string S of length N.\nOn Day i(1 \u2266 i \u2266 N), he will travel a positive distance in the following direction:\n\nNorth if the i-th letter of S is N\nWest if the i-th letter of S is W\nSouth if the i-th letter of S is S\nEast if the i-th letter of S is E\n\nHe has not decided each day's travel distance. Determine whether it is possible to set each day's travel distance so that he will be back at home at the end of Day N.", "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "5", "pythonic": "5", "error_handling": "4", "efficiency": "4"}}
