Let X_i denote the i-th element of X.\nYou are given a sequence A of length N. The i-th element of A is A_i. Determine if we can make X equal to A by repeating the operation below. If we can, find the minimum number of operations required.\n\nChoose an integer i such that 1\\leq i\\leq N-1. Replace the value of X_{i+1} with the value of X_i plus 1.", "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "5", "pythonic": "5", "error_handling": "4", "efficiency": "5"}}
