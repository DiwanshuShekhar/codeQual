"""
A ball will bounce along a number line, making N + 1 bounces. It will make the first bounce at coordinate D_1 = 0, and the i-th bounce (2 \leq i \leq N+1) at coordinate D_i = D_{i-1} + L_{i-1}.
How many times will the ball make a bounce where the coordinate is at most X?
Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
