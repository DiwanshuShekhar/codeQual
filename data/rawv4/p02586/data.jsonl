{"problem_id": "p02586", "submission_id": "s159965483", "problem_description": "There are K items placed on a grid of squares with R rows and C columns. Let (i, j) denote the square at the i-th row (1 \\leq i \\leq R) and the j-th column (1 \\leq j \\leq C). The i-th item is at (r_i, c_i) and has the value v_i.\nTakahashi will begin at (1, 1), the start, and get to (R, C), the goal. When he is at (i, j), he can move to (i + 1, j) or (i, j + 1) (but cannot move to a non-existent square).\nHe can pick up items on the squares he visits, including the start and the goal, but at most three for each row. It is allowed to ignore the item on a square he visits.\nFind the maximum possible sum of the values of items he picks up.", "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "5", "pythonic": "5", "error_handling": "5", "efficiency": "5"}}
