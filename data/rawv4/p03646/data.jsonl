Consider performing the following operation on this sequence until the largest element in this sequence becomes N-1 or smaller.\n\nDetermine the largest element in the sequence (if there is more than one, choose one). Decrease the value of this element by N, and increase each of the other elements by 1.\n\nIt can be proved that the largest element in the sequence becomes N-1 or smaller after a finite number of operations.\nYou are given an integer K. Find an integer sequence a_i such that the number of times we will perform the above operation is exactly K. It can be shown that there is always such a sequence under the constraints on input and output in this problem.", "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "3", "pythonic": "3", "error_handling": "1", "efficiency": "3"}}
