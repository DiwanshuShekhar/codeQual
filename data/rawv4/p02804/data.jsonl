If we distinguish elements with different indices even when their values are the same, there are {}_N C_K ways to make this choice. Find the sum of f(S) over all those ways.\nSince the answer can be enormous, print it \\bmod (10^9+7).", "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "5", "pythonic": "5", "error_handling": "4", "efficiency": "5"}}
