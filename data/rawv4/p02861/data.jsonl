The distance between Town i and Town j is \\sqrt{\\left(x_i-x_j\\right)^2+\\left(y_i-y_j\\right)^2}.\nThere are N! possible paths to visit all of these towns once. Let the length of a path be the distance covered when we start at the first town in the path, visit the second, third, \\dots, towns, and arrive at the last town (assume that we travel in a straight line from a town to another). Compute the average length of these N! paths.", "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "5", "pythonic": "5", "error_handling": "5", "efficiency": "5"}}
