    # Helper function to calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two integers

"""
The helper function `gcd` from the `math` library calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The LCM is then calculated using the formula LCM(a, b) = |a*b| / GCD(a, b).

In this specific scenario where we want to find the minimum positive integer divisible by both 2 and N, we can calculate the LCM of 2 and N directly. The problem statement essentially describes the LCM of 2 and N, as the smallest positive integer divisible by both 2 and N.
