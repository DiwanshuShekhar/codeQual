Find f(A, B).\n\nWhat is exclusive OR?\nThe bitwise exclusive OR of integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (let us call it y) is defined as follows:\n\nWhen y is written in base two, the digit in the 2^k's place (k \\geq 0) is 1 if, the number of integers among c_1, c_2, ...c_m whose binary representations have 1 in the 2^k's place, is odd, and 0 if that count is even.\n\nFor example, the exclusive OR of 3 and 5 is 6. (When written in base two: the exclusive OR of 011 and 101 is 110.)", "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "5", "pythonic": "5", "error_handling": "4", "efficiency": "5"}}
