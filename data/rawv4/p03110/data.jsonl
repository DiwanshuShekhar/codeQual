Each string u_i is either JPY or BTC, and x_i and u_i represent the content of the otoshidama from the i-th relative.\nFor example, if x_1 = 10000 and u_1 = JPY, the otoshidama from the first relative is 10000 Japanese yen; if x_2 = 0.10000000 and u_2 = BTC, the otoshidama from the second relative is 0.1 bitcoins.\nIf we convert the bitcoins into yen at the rate of 380000.0 JPY per 1.0 BTC, how much are the gifts worth in total?", "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "5", "pythonic": "5", "error_handling": "4", "efficiency": "5"}}
