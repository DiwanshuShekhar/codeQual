{"problem_id": "p03222", "submission_id": "s390814329", "problem_description": "Amidakuji is a traditional method of lottery in Japan.\nTo make an amidakuji, we first draw W parallel vertical lines, and then draw horizontal lines that connect them. The length of each vertical line is H+1 [cm], and the endpoints of the horizontal lines must be at 1, 2, 3, ..., or H [cm] from the top of a vertical line.\nA valid amidakuji is an amidakuji that satisfies the following conditions:\n\nNo two horizontal lines share an endpoint.\nThe two endpoints of each horizontal lines must be at the same height.\nA horizontal line must connect adjacent vertical lines.\n\n\nFind the number of the valid amidakuji that satisfy the following condition, modulo 1\\ 000\\ 000\\ 007: if we trace the path from the top of the leftmost vertical line to the bottom, always following horizontal lines when we encounter them, we reach the bottom of the K-th vertical line from the left.\nFor example, in the following amidakuji, we will reach the bottom of the fourth vertical line from the left.", "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "1", "pythonic": "1", "error_handling": "1", "efficiency": "2"}}
