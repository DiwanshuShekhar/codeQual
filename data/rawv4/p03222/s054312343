#### Code 1
```python
n,h = map(int,input().split())
a = [0]*n
b = [0]*n
for i in range(n):
    a[i], b[i] = map(int,input().split())
a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
b = sorted(b, reverse=True)
c = 0
j = 0
while j<n:
    if b[j] > a[0]:
        c += b[j]
    else:
        break
    j += 1
    if c >= h:
        break

if c < h:
    j += -(-(h-c)//a[0])
print(j)
```

**Criteria Scores**

```json
{"functionality": "4", "readability": "3", "pythonic": "3", "error_handling": "1", "efficiency": "3"}
```

**Explanation**:
- Functionality: The code seems to implement the logic as described in the task but lacks explicit input validation (e.g., non-negative integers, ensuring n and h are within a reasonable range, etc.). It assumes the input is well-formatted.
- Readability: Variable names could be more descriptive, making the code harder to follow. The logic, however, is straightforward.
- Pythonic: Uses list comprehensions and sorted, which is good, but could further improve by better leveraging Python's standard library.
- Error Handling: No explicit error handling or validation of input.
- Efficiency: The sorting operations and while loop could become inefficient for very large datasets, but the algorithm itself is reasonably efficient for the task.
