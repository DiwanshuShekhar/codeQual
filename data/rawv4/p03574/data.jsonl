For each square, there are at most eight adjacent squares.)\nHe decides to replace each . in our H strings with a digit that represents the number of bomb squares adjacent to the corresponding empty square.  \nPrint the strings after the process.", "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "5", "pythonic": "5", "error_handling": "5", "efficiency": "5"}}
