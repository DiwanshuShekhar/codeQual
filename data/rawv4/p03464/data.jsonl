The others proceed to the next round.\nNote that it's possible that nobody leaves the game in some round.\nIn the end, after the K-th round, there are exactly two children left, and they are declared the winners.\nYou have heard the values of A_1, A_2, ..., A_K. You don't know N, but you want to estimate it.\nFind the smallest and the largest possible number of children in the game before the start, or determine that no valid values of N exist.", "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "5", "pythonic": "5", "error_handling": "5", "efficiency": "5"}}
