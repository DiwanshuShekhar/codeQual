"""
You are given a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.
We will cut this string at one position into two strings X and Y.
Here, we would like to maximize the number of different letters contained in both X and Y.
Find the largest possible number of different letters contained in both X and Y when we cut the string at the optimal position.
Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
