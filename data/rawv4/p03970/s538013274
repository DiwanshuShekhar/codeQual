"""
CODE FESTIVAL 2016 is going to be held. For the occasion, Mr. Takahashi decided to make a signboard.
He intended to write CODEFESTIVAL2016 on it, but he mistakenly wrote a different string S. Fortunately, the string he wrote was the correct length.
So Mr. Takahashi decided to perform an operation that replaces a certain character with another in the minimum number of iterations, changing the string to CODEFESTIVAL2016.
Find the minimum number of iterations for the rewrite operation.
