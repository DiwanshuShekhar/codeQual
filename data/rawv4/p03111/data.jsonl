The lengths (in centimeters) of these are l_1, l_2, ..., l_N, respectively.\nYour objective is to use some of these bamboos (possibly all) to obtain three bamboos of length A, B, C. For that, you can use the following three kinds of magics any number:\n\nExtension Magic: Consumes 1 MP (magic point). Choose one bamboo and increase its length by 1.\nShortening Magic: Consumes 1 MP. Choose one bamboo of length at least 2 and decrease its length by 1.\nComposition Magic: Consumes 10 MP. Choose two bamboos and combine them into one bamboo. The length of this new bamboo is equal to the sum of the lengths of the two bamboos combined. (Afterwards, further magics can be used on this bamboo.)\n\nAt least how much MP is needed to achieve the objective?", "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "5", "pythonic": "5", "error_handling": "5", "efficiency": "5"}}
