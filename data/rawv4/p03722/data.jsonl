After this move, the score of the player is increased by c_i.\n\nThe player can end the game only when the piece is placed at vertex N.\nThe given graph guarantees that it is possible to traverse from vertex 1 to vertex N.\nWhen the player acts optimally to maximize the score at the end of the game, what will the score be?\nIf it is possible to increase the score indefinitely, print inf.", "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "5", "pythonic": "5", "error_handling": "4", "efficiency": "4"}}
