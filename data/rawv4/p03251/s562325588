"""
Our world is one-dimensional, and ruled by two empires called Empire A and Empire B.
The capital of Empire A is located at coordinate X, and that of Empire B is located at coordinate Y.
One day, Empire A becomes inclined to put the cities at coordinates x_1, x_2, ..., x_N under its control, and Empire B becomes inclined to put the cities at coordinates y_1, y_2, ..., y_M under its control.
If there exists an integer Z that satisfies all of the following three conditions, they will come to an agreement, but otherwise war will break out.

X < Z \leq Y
x_1, x_2, ..., x_N < Z
y_1, y_2, ..., y_M \geq Z

Determine if war will break out.
