The elevation of Obs. i is H_i.\nThere are also M roads, each connecting two different observatories. Road j connects Obs. A_j and Obs. B_j.\nObs. i is said to be good when its elevation is higher than those of all observatories that can be reached from Obs. i using just one road.\nNote that Obs. i is also good when no observatory can be reached from Obs. i using just one road.\nHow many good observatories are there?", "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "5", "pythonic": "5", "error_handling": "4", "efficiency": "4"}}
