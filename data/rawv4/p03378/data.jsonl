Your goal is to reach Square 0 or Square N.\nHowever, for each i = 1, 2, ..., M, there is a toll gate in Square A_i, and traveling to Square A_i incurs a cost of 1.\nIt is guaranteed that there is no toll gate in Square 0, Square X and Square N.\nFind the minimum cost incurred before reaching the goal.", "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "5", "pythonic": "5", "error_handling": "4", "efficiency": "4"}}
