He will play the following game with them:\n\nThrow the die. The current score is the result of the die.\nAs long as the score is between 1 and K-1 (inclusive), keep flipping the coin. The score is doubled each time the coin lands heads up, and the score becomes 0 if the coin lands tails up.\nThe game ends when the score becomes 0 or becomes K or above. Snuke wins if the score is K or above, and loses if the score is 0.\n\nYou are given N and K. Find the probability that Snuke wins the game.", "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "5", "pythonic": "5", "error_handling": "4", "efficiency": "4"}}
