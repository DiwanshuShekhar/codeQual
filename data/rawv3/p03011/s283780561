There are three airports A, B and C, and flights between each pair of airports in both directions.
A one-way flight between airports A and B takes P hours, a one-way flight between airports B and C takes Q hours, and a one-way flight between airports C and A takes R hours.
Consider a route where we start at one of the airports, fly to another airport and then fly to the other airport.
What is the minimum possible sum of the flight times?
