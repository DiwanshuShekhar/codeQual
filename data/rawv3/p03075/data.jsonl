They are called Antenna A, B, C, D and E from west to east, and their coordinates are a, b, c, d and e, respectively.\nTwo antennas can communicate directly if the distance between them is k or less, and they cannot if the distance is greater than k.\nDetermine if there exists a pair of antennas that cannot communicate directly.\nHere, assume that the distance between two antennas at coordinates p and q (p < q) is q - p.", "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "5", "pythonic": "5", "error_handling": "4", "efficiency": "5"}}
