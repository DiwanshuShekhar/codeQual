In one set of training, a member can reduce his/her consumption coefficient by 1, as long as it does not go below 0. However, for financial reasons, the N members can do at most K sets of training in total.\nWhat is the minimum possible score of the team, achieved by choosing the amounts of members' training and allocating the dishes optimally?", "quality_score": {"functionality": "3", "readability": "3", "pythonic": "3", "error_handling": "1", "efficiency": "4"}}
