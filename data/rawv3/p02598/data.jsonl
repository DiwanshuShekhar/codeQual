When a log of length L is cut at a point whose distance from an end of the log is t (0<t<L), it becomes two logs of lengths t and L-t.\nFind the shortest possible length of the longest log after at most K cuts, and print it after rounding up to an integer.", "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "5", "pythonic": "5", "error_handling": "4", "efficiency": "4"}}
