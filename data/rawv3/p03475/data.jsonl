No other trains will be operated.\nThe first train from Station i to Station i+1 will depart Station i S_i seconds after the ceremony begins. Thereafter, there will be a train that departs Station i every F_i seconds.\nHere, it is guaranteed that F_i divides S_i.\nThat is, for each Time t satisfying S_i\u2264t and t\uff05F_i=0, there will be a train that departs Station i t seconds after the ceremony begins and arrives at Station i+1 t+C_i seconds after the ceremony begins, where A\uff05B denotes A modulo B, and there will be no other trains.\nFor each i, find the earliest possible time we can reach Station N if we are at Station i when the ceremony begins, ignoring the time needed to change trains.", "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "5", "pythonic": "5", "error_handling": "5", "efficiency": "5"}}
