The approach involves prime factorization to decompose the target product into prime factors and then calculate the combinations through combinatorial functions.", "readability": "The readability is moderately high since the code is structured with well-named functions, clear variable names, and logical separations of tasks. Moreover, comments and function names like 'prime_factorize', 'cmb', and 'make_tables' convey the intent effectively", "pythonic": "The code uses Pythonic constructs effectively, such as list comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions, and modular arithmetic functions. It follows PEP 8 guidelines for naming conventions and code layout. The usage of predefined math and itertools libraries leverages Python's standard capabilities for mathematical computations.", "error_handling": "The code does not include explicit error handling routines, but it gracefully handles edge cases through conditional checks, such as in the 'cmb' function where it returns 0 for invalid combinations, and by validating input values initially.", "efficiency": "The algorithm is efficient in terms of its computational complexity, utilizing dynamic programming techniques to avoid redundant calculations. Prime factorization and the creation of factorial tables upfront optimize the process of computing combinations. The approach ensures polynomial time complexity, suitable for the input constraints provided."}, "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "4", "pythonic": "4", "error_handling": "3", "efficiency": "4"}}

It uses a combination formula and modular arithmetic as required by the problem. It efficiently computes factorials and their inverses modulo 10^9+7 for the combination calculations.", "readability": "The code structure is clear with meaningful variable names and modular function usage, making it relatively easy to follow the logic for solving the problem. Usage of helper functions for specific tasks improves readability.", "pythonic": "The code makes good use of Python features like list comprehensions and modular arithmetic functions. It doesn't overly rely on Python-specific libraries or constructs for the core algorithm, adhering well to Python coding principles.", "error_handling": "There isn't explicit error handling, but the problem constraints are adhered to within the provided functions. Inputs are straightforward and operated upon with the assumption of being within valid ranges specified by the problem. The main logic is error-resistant based on problem constraints.", "efficiency": "The solution is efficient, especially in computing factorials and their inverses modulo 10^9+7, which could be a bottleneck. Prime factorization is performed in a straightforward manner, and combination calculations are optimized with precomputed values and modularity, contributing to overall efficiency."}, "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "4", "pythonic": "4", "error_handling": "3", "efficiency": "5"}}
