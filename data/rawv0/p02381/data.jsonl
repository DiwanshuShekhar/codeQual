It correctly handles repeated input until a '0' is entered, indicating the end of input. The standard deviation calculation uses the formula correctly, including computing the mean and the sum of squared differences.", "readability": "The code is quite readable, with clear variable names for the most part. The use of a 'while True' loop with a break condition is a common and understandable pattern.", "pythonic": "The use of a while loop for continuous input is appropriate. The code uses list comprehension and built-in functions like sum(), which are Pythonic. However, there could be more Pythonic approaches for handling the loop condition and input.", "error_handling": "There's minimal error handling. The code assumes correct input format and does not explicitly handle potential input errors or exceptions that could occur with conversion to int or when the input list is empty.", "efficiency": "The code efficiency is reasonable for the problem size. It iterates through each list of scores once to calculate the standard deviation. However, it does recalculate the mean with every iteration, which could be optimized."}, "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "4", "pythonic": "4", "error_handling": "2", "efficiency": "3"}}

It reads the number of students and their scores, calculates the mean and variance, and finally computes the standard deviation using the square root of the variance. The code also properly handles multiple sets of inputs until a zero is encountered, indicating the end of input.", "readability": "The code is generally well-structured and follows a logical flow that is easy to follow. However, it could benefit from more descriptive variable names than 'mean', 'a2', and 'a' to improve readability.", "pythonic": "The code makes good use of Python's built-in functions and libraries such as `math.sqrt` for calculating the square root. However, it could make better use of Python's list comprehensions and the `statistics` module for calculating mean and standard deviation to make the code more Pythonic.", "error_handling": "The code properly checks for the end of input using a `while True` loop and breaks out of it when a zero is encountered. However, there is no explicit error handling for non-numeric input or other potential input errors.", "efficiency": "The code is efficient for the purpose it serves. However, if dealing with a very large number of students and scores, using array operations from libraries such as NumPy could potentially improve performance."}, "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "4", "pythonic": "4", "error_handling": "3", "efficiency": "4"}}

It reads and processes multiple test cases as expected, with a proper termination condition when n is 0.", "readability": "The code is relatively easy to read and understand. Variable names, while short, are somewhat indicative of their purpose. The loop structure is clear, and the steps for calculating the average, the sum of squared differences, and the standard deviation itself are logically organized.", "pythonic": "The use of list comprehensions, map, and the math module are appropriate and Pythonic. The approach taken to read input until a termination case is met is a common and suitable method for dealing with unknown numbers of test cases.", "error_handling": "There's no explicit error handling for incorrect inputs, but given the problem constraints, this might not be necessary.", "efficiency": "The use of repeated calls to math.sqrt and sum within a loop is potentially inefficient for very large inputs, but for the constraints given in the problem, it should perform adequately."}, "quality_score": {"functionality": "5", "readability": "4", "pythonic": "4", "error_handling": "3", "efficiency": "3"}}
